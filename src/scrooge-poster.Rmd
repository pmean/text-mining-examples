Abstract 
================================================================================

Data science is a new and exciting discipline that touches many academic departments. It draws upon the strengths of Computer Science and Statistics and has been used successfully in Business, Education, Medicine, and Science. We need to promote data science early, at the undergraduate and high school level. Unfortunately, many of the applications of data science require specialized content knowlege and/or advanced mathematical and programming skills.

Text mining is an example of data science that is easily accessible at any level of education, requires no mathematics beyond basic counting, and can be easily programmed in any language. It uses simple graphical summaries. It allows for simple improvements and customization. Most importantly, it can be applied to areas where students already have a high level of familiarity.

This poster shows a simple application of text mining to a popular and well-known book, A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens.

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

```

Major points {.block}
================================================================================

## Data science need *better teaching examples*. These examples need to be *easy to run* and *easy to relate to*.

## The ideal choice is *text mining* because it requires *no complex mathematics* and *no specialized programming*

## The *best data source* for text mining is "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens. It is *universally recognized* and has a *well demarcated plot line*.
