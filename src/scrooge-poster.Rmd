Introduction 
================================================================================

Data science is a new and exciting discipline that touches many academic departments. It draws upon the strengths of Computer Science and Statistics and has been used successfully in Business, Education, Medicine, and Science. We need to promote data science early, at the undergraduate and high school level. Unfortunately, many of the applications of data science require specialized content knowlege and/or advanced mathematical and programming skills.

Text mining is an example of data science that is easily accessible at any level of education, requires no mathematics beyond basic counting, and can be easily programmed in any language. It uses simple graphical summaries. It allows for simple improvements and customization. Most importantly, it can be applied to areas where students already have a high level of familiarity.

This poster shows a simple application of text mining to a popular and well-known book, A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens.

Methods
================================================================================

The raw text for "A Christmas Carol" was downloaded from the Guttenberg Project website (www.guttenberg.org) and read using the R programming language (version 3.4.3) and the setimentr package.

The actual analysis, however, does not this system and can easily be replicated. Here are the steps:

* Pre-process the data
  + Remove punctuation
  + Convert everything to lower case
  + Split into individual words
* Merge with sentiment lexicon
  + Assign zero to unmatched words
  + Compute moving average
* Plot the results
  + Add labels

There are several publicly available sentiment lexicons. These are lists of words with positive and negative sentiments.

Table 1. Raw data
================================================================================

```{r raw-data, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(magrittr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(sentimentr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(SnowballC)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(tidytext)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(tidyverse)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(wordcloud)))
load("../data/christmas-carol.RData")
# cat(cc_trimmed_text[353:359], sep="\n")
```

'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning.'

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,
twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.

Major points {.block}
================================================================================

## Data science need *better teaching examples*, especially if we want to reach undergraduate and high school students. These examples need to be *easy to run* and *easy to relate to*.

## The ideal choice is *text mining*  and *sentiment analysis* because it requires *no complex mathematics* and *no specialized programming*

## The *best data source* for text mining is "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens. This book is *universally recognized* and has a *well demarcated plot line*.

## Limitations

While this sentiment analysis provides some interesting results, you should encourage your students to discuss the limitations of the data analysis and steps that they might take to improve it. Some possible areas of discussion might include:

* How to handle abstract images
  + There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
relate.
* How to handle negations 
  + 'It's **not convenient**,' said Scrooge, 'and it's **not fair**.
* How to handle sarcasm
  + 'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'
returned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to
die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'
* How to handle double meanings
  + ... though the Spirit's eyes were clear and **kind**, he did not like to meet them.
  + 'Would it apply to any **kind** of dinner on this day?' asked Scrooge.

These limitations (as well as approaches to address these limitations) are well undestood among the experts in text mining, but it would be a useful exercise to see if your students could recognize these limitations on their own and see what suggestions they might offer to fix things.

## Extend to other texts

There are many freely available text sources that are just as easy to conduct sentiment analysis on. Here are some examples.

* Psalms. There are a wide range of emotions in individual psalms  ranging from lamentations to thanksgiving, from curses of the enemy to praises of God.
* Donald Trump's twitter feed. Love him or hate him, President Trump has provided a range of emotions in his tweets, and these correlate strongly with key events during his presidency.

Authors' contributions
================================================================================

Charles Dickens provided the raw data. Steve Simon analyzed the data and produced the graphs.
