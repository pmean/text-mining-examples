"5","MARLEY'S GHOST"
"6",""
"7","Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that."
"8","The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the"
"9","undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name"
"10","was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old"
"11","Marley was as dead as a door-nail."
"12",""
"13","Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is"
"14","particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,"
"15","to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the"
"16","trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my"
"17","unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You"
"18","will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as"
"19","dead as a door-nail."
"20",""
"21","Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?"
"22","Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge"
"23","was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole"
"24","residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge"
"25","was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an"
"26","excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised"
"27","it with an undoubted bargain."
"28",""
"29","The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started"
"30","from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly"
"31","understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to"
"32","relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died"
"33","before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his"
"34","taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,"
"35","than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning"
"36","out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for"
"37","instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind."
"38",""
"39","Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years"
"40","afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was"
"41","known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called"
"42","Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It"
"43","was all the same to him."
"44",""
"45","Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a"
"46","squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old"
"47","sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out"
"48","generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster."
"49","The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,"
"50","shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin"
"51","lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime"
"52","was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his"
"53","own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the"
"54","dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas."
"55",""
"56","External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could"
"57","warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than"
"58","he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain"
"59","less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The"
"60","heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the"
"61","advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'"
"62","handsomely, and Scrooge never did."
"63",""
"64","Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My"
"65","dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars"
"66","implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was"
"67","o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to"
"68","such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to"
"69","know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into"
"70","doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they"
"71","said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'"
"72",""
"73","But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his"
"74","way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep"
"75","its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge."
"76",""
"77","Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas"
"78","Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,"
"79","biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court"
"80","outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,"
"81","and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City"
"82","clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had"
"83","not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the"
"84","neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The"
"85","fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense"
"86","without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses"
"87","opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,"
"88","obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,"
"89","and was brewing on a large scale."
"90",""
"91","The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his"
"92","eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,"
"93","was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire"
"94","was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't"
"95","replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so"
"96","surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that"
"97","it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his"
"98","white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which"
"99","effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed."
"100",""
"101","'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was"
"102","the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this"
"103","was the first intimation he had of his approach."
"104",""
"105","'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'"
"106",""
"107","He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this"
"108","nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and"
"109","handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again."
"110",""
"111","'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean"
"112","that, I am sure?'"
"113",""
"114","'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?"
"115","What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'"
"116",""
"117","'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be"
"118","dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'"
"119",""
"120","Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,"
"121","'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'"
"122",""
"123","'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew."
"124",""
"125","'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world"
"126","of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's"
"127","Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time"
"128","for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for"
"129","balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen"
"130","of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said"
"131","Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with ""Merry Christmas"""
"132","on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a"
"133","stake of holly through his heart. He should!'"
"134",""
"135","'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew."
"136",""
"137","'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,"
"138","and let me keep it in mine.'"
"139",""
"140","'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'"
"141",""
"142","'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!"
"143","Much good it has ever done you!'"
"144",""
"145","'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I"
"146","have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among"
"147","the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when"
"148","it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and"
"149","origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good"
"150","time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know"
"151","of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one"
"152","consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people"
"153","below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and"
"154","not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,"
"155","uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I"
"156","believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God"
"157","bless it!'"
"158",""
"159","The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately"
"160","sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the"
"161","last frail spark for ever."
"162",""
"163","'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep"
"164","your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful"
"165","speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go"
"166","into Parliament.'"
"167",""
"168","'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'"
"169",""
"170","Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the"
"171","whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that"
"172","extremity first."
"173",""
"174","'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'"
"175",""
"176","'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge."
"177",""
"178","'Because I fell in love.'"
"179",""
"180","'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only"
"181","one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good"
"182","afternoon!'"
"183",""
"184","'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give"
"185","it as a reason for not coming now?'"
"186",""
"187","'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge."

"195","had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial"
"196","in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last."
"197","So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'"
"198",""
"199","'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge."
"200",""
"201","'And A Happy New Year!'"
"202",""
"203","'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge."
"204",""
"205","His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He"
"206","stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the"
"207","clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned"
"208","them cordially."
"209",""
"210","'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my"
"211","clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking"
"212","about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'"
"213",""
"214","This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people"
"215","in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with"
"216","their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their"
"217","hands, and bowed to him."
"218",""
"219","'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring"
"220","to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr."

"222",""
"223","'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died"

"230",""
"231","It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous"

"235","'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,"
"236","taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make"
"237","some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at"
"238","the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;"

"241","'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge."

"243","'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again."

"252",""
"253","'Both very busy, sir.'"
"254",""
"255","'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had"
"256","occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very"
"257","glad to hear it.'"
"258",""
"259","'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind"
"260","or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are"
"261","endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and"
"262","means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all"
"263","others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I"

"266","'Nothing!' Scrooge replied."
"267",""
"268","'You wish to be anonymous?'"
"269",""
"270","'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,"
"271","gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,"
"272","and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the"
"273","establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are"
"274","badly off must go there.'"
"275",""
"276","'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'"
"277",""
"278","'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and"
"279","decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'"
"280",""
"281","'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman."
"282",""
"283","'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to"
"284","understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's."
"285","Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'"
"286",""
"287","Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the"
"288","gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion"
"289","of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him."
"290",""
"291","Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with"
"292","flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in"
"293","carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,"
"294","whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a"
"295","Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and"
"296","quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its"
"297","teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became"
"298","intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers"
"299","were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,"
"300","round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their"
"301","hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug"
"302","being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned"
"303","to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and"
"304","berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy"
"305","as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:"
"306","a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that"
"307","such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord"
"308","Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his"
"309","fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household"
"310","should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on"
"311","the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,"
"312","stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and"
"313","the baby sallied out to buy the beef."
"314",""
"315","Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good"
"316","St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such"
"317","weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he"
"318","would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,"
"319","gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,"
"320","stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;"
"321","but, at the first sound of"

"323","  'God bless you, merry gentleman,"
"324","  May nothing you dismay!'"

"326","Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled"

"328","frost."
"329",""
"330","At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an"
"331","ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the"
"332","fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his"

"357",""
"358","The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl."
"359","The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends"
"360","of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no"
"361","greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,"
"362","twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to"
"363","Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff."
"364",""
"365","Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and"
"366","having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening"
"367","with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had"
"368","once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of"
"369","rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little"
"370","business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run"
"371","there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other"
"372","houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and"
"373","dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms"
"374","being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,"
"375","who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and"
"376","frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed"
"377","as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the"
"378","threshold."
"379",""
"380","Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the"
"381","knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact"
"382","that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence"
"383","in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy"
"384","about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a"
"385","bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne"
"386","in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his"
"387","last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then"
"388","let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,"
"389","having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its"
"390","undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but"
"391","Marley's face."
"392",""
"393","Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects"
"394","in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in"
"395","a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as"
"396","Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly"
"397","forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;"
"398","and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless."
"399","That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to"
"400","be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of"
"401","its own expression."
"402",""
"403","As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again."
"404",""
"405","To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of"
"406","a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would"
"407","be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned"
"408","it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle."
"409",""
"410","He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;"
"411","and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to"
"412","be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the"
"413","hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws"
"414","and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed"
"415","it with a bang."
"416",""
"417","The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,"
"418","and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a"
"419","separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be"
"420","frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,"
"421","and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went."
"422",""
"423","You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight"
"424","of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say"
"425","you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,"
"426","with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the"
"427","balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and"
"428","room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a"
"429","locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen"
"430","gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so"
"431","you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip."
"432",""
"433","Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and"
"434","Scrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through"
"435","his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of"
"436","the face to desire to do that."
"437",""

"450","Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double"
"451","locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against"
"452","surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,"
"453","and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel."
"454",""
"455","It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was"
"456","obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract"
"457","the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace"
"458","was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all"
"459","round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures."
"460","There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,"
"461","Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like"
"462","feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in"
"463","butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that"
"464","face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,"
"465","and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at"
"466","first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the"
"467","disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of"
"468","old Marley's head on every one."
"469",""
"470","'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room."
"471",""
"472","After several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the"
"473","chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that"
"474","hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with"
"475","a chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great"
"476","astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he"
"477","looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the"
"478","outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and"
"479","so did every bell in the house."
"480",""
"481","This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an"
"482","hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded"
"483","by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a"
"484","heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then"
"485","remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as"
"486","dragging chains."
"487",""
"488","The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the"
"489","noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then"
"490","coming straight towards his door."

"494","His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through"
"495","the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming"

"497","Ghost!' and fell again."
"498",""
"499","The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,"
"500","tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his"
"501","pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he"
"502","drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like"
"503","a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,"
"504","keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His"
"505","body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking"
"506","through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind."
"507",""
"508","Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had"
"509","never believed it until now."
"510",""
"511","No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through"

"513","influence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the"
"514","folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not"
"515","observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his"

"523","'Who are you?'"

"527","'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're"

"531","'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'"

"537","'Do it, then.'"
"538",""
"539","Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so"
"540","transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt"
"541","that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the"
"542","necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the"

"560",""
"561","Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in"
"562","his heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be"
"563","smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his"
"564","terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones."
"565",""
"566","To sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,"
"567","would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something"
"568","very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal"
"569","atmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was"
"570","clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its"
"571","hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour"
"572","from an oven."
"573",""
"574","'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,"
"575","for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a"
"576","second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself."
"577",""
"578","'I do,' replied the Ghost."

"580","'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge."

"587",""
"588","At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such"
"589","a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,"
"590","to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his"
"591","horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it"
"592","were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its"
"593","breast!"
"594",""
"595","Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face."

"619","my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'"
"620",""
"621","Scrooge trembled more and more."
"622",""
"623","'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the"
"624","strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this"
"625","seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a"

"640","spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;"
"641","and weary journeys lie before me!'"
"642",""
"643","It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his"

"687","trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my"

"820","extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and"
"821","fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if"
"822","night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This"

"876","It was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like"
"877","an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the"
"878","appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a"
"879","child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its"
"880","back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in"
"881","it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and"
"882","muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength."
"883","Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper"
"884","members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist"

"2247","pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to"
"2248","assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her"
"2249","finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No"

"2588","closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by"
